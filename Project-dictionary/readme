Here how it works

The main webpage (User Interface) has a text field for the User to enter a word and a Lookup Button to
request the definition of the word. When the User clicks the Lookup Button, a JavaScript event handler
(in file dict.js) is invoked that contains a jQuery Ajax call. The Ajax call picks up the word from the text
field and sends it to the Web Server (Dictionary.js). Then the Server calls word.js to find the definition(s)
of the word in the SQL Dictionary, and then converts the definition(s) into JSON format and transmits it
back to the JavaScript in dict.js, where jQuery is used to display the definition(s) on the website. If there
are multiple definitions, then all should be displayed. The above picture is a simple example of a display.


files:
1. dict.html: displays the webpage containing the User Interface
2. dict.css: styling for dict.html
3. dict.js: JavaScript event handlers for dict.html, it handles the onclick event. It sends a page get request to the server(Dictionary.js) once user input and click lookup,
4. jQuery.js: have a global function that updates the page with the data fetched from sql 
5. Dictionary.js: Node.js web server for this web site, it starts the server and recives client request and send it to word.js
6. word.js: Node.js program to lookup the term in the database, collect the meanings,
and send JSON to Browser


In oreder to work, remember to start the server first by running: node Dictionary.js
Then go the dict.html and search words
